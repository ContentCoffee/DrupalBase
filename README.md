# A Drupal Project

This is the default readme file that come from the Content and Coffee drupal base repo.

Ideally this should have been replaced or updated.

## What to do with this?

Run the start script.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ContentCoffee/DrupalBase/master/start.sh | sh
```

This will download the repo, unzip it to your current directory, then run composer install.
